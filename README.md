# 311
I want to manipulate the data from NYC 311 calls (nonemergency 911), 2010-present.
The original dataset contains around 750,000 rows and about 52 columns.
I'm only interested in look at noise complaints (multiple categories within noise).
I want to retain the columns that include the primary key, the date and time the call was made, the complaint type, the zip code, the city, and the borough.
This project will focus on time series data and generally having fun.
